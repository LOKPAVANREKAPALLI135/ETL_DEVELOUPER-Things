Computer is a machine made of 2 major components
-> Hardware (physical components of a computer)
-> Software (set of programs used to automate a task)

DBMS Concepts

DBMS stands for Data Base Management System  
(It is a process of creating and maintain databases)

Data		: Collection of raw facts and figures (alphabet, symbols and numbers)
		  Data is a value without any identity.  It is also called as Raw Data.
		  Ex: 50,     David,	10-jun-2020

Information	: Data given with an identity is called Information.
		  Information is always meaningful.
		  Age=50,  Emp_name="David",  Joining date="10-jun-2020"

DataBase	: Information given in an organized format
		  It is also called as Table (combination of rows and columns)
		  These databases are of 2 types
		--> Manual database
		    -is slow in processing		
		    -suitable for small amount of data
		    -it occupies lot of space
		--> Electronic database
		    -they are created and maintained using a software
		    -is fast in processing
		    -suitable for small or large quantities of data
		    -it occupies very less space

Database Management : The process of creating, adding, deleting, updating and searching data is called 
		      database management. It is generally done using software

DBMS		: The software used for database management is called DBMS package.
		  Ex: Dbase, foxbase, foxpro, sybase, oracle, MS sql server, mysql, mongo db, PostgrySQL

Data Models :
-------------
These are the various methods used to create and maintain data from olden times to the latest time

FMS   : File Management System
	Data is create and stored in a flat file (text file format)
	Limitations:
	- data is stored in a unsecured file
	- data creating standards are not fixed
	- data is accessed sequentially, so very slow in processing

DBMS  : Database Management System
	Advantages:
	- data is stored in a secured login that is protected with username and password
	- data creating standards are fixed. we use the datatypes for each column
	- data is accessed sequentially or randomly, so very fast in processing

Types of DBMS:
--------------
HDBMS : Hierarchical Database Management System
	This type of data is stored in the form of levels and sub levels

NDBMS : Network Database Management System
	Data is created and stored in a network server.
	So, it can be accessed from many client systems

RDBMS : Relational Database Management System
	Data is created in different tables and these tables are linked by using 
	primary key - foreign key relation
	Ex: In below example 'ccode' of courses table is related to 'course_no' of students table
			courses				
		ccode   cname   fees             
		101	oracle	5000		
		102	java	10000
		103	aws	15000

				students
		idno    stud_name   course_no   paid_amt
		1	ramu		101	1000
		2	shyam		101	500
		3	swamy		103	3000
		4	raju		103	9000
